#### Text:

Dijkstra's Algorithm is a popular and widely used method in optimization. As it efficiently calculates a shortest path in any connected Digraph with positive arc weights. 

At its core stands the idea that after having found the shortest path to a node, this result is stored in the list of "permanent" nodes and its value can be used for further calculations. This is possible because of the exclusive use of positive (or zero value) arc weights. Calculated shortest paths do not need to be corrected.
A "pseudo-code" for this algorithm can be written as follows.

#### Bullet Points:
- The entries in the matrix above represent costs associated with the positions in the rectangle.
- We are interested in finding an optimal (min-cost) route from the top left-hand corner (origin) to the bottom
