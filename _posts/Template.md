#### Text:

Dijkstra's Algorithm is a popular and widely used method in optimization. As it efficiently calculates a shortest path in any connected Digraph with positive arc weights. 

At its core stands the idea that after having found the shortest path to a node, this result is stored in the list of "permanent" nodes and its value can be used for further calculations. This is possible because of the exclusive use of positive (or zero value) arc weights. Calculated shortest paths do not need to be corrected.
A "pseudo-code" for this algorithm can be written as follows.

#### HTML-Image:
<img src="/images/MYIMAGE.png" alt="alt-text" height="42" width="42">

#### Emphasis:
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.
Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.
Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.
Strike-through uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~
