# Dynamic Programming
### Shortest Path Problem in a Grid

When I got this assignment in one of my classes (Stochastic Dynamic Programming) I looked for example code online. My impression was that, for whatever reason, this problem is popularly solved in C++. After figuring out how to do it in Python I thought I'd share it here as an example code, mainly because I want to practice this whole github.io thingd.
