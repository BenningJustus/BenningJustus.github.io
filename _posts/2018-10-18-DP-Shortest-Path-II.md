# Shortest Path Problem in a Grid - Revisited
### Solving a common problem using recursive functions in Python
#### Introduction
In my first post I talked about a Python implementation, that recursively solves a Shortest Path problem in a grid.
Additionally, I admitted it was not a very efficient approach. To show why, here is the output of the console if you actually run the program:
> 
```The current shortest path is 5 for cell (4, 4)
The current shortest path is 13 for cell (4, 3)
The current shortest path is 16 for cell (4, 2)
The current shortest path is 16 for cell (4, 1)
The current shortest path is 5 for cell (4, 4)
The current shortest path is 13 for cell (4, 3)
The current shortest path is 16 for cell (4, 2)
The current shortest path is 5 for cell (4, 4)
The current shortest path is 13 for cell (4, 3)
The current shortest path is 5 for cell (4, 4)
The current shortest path is 9 for cell (3, 5)
The current shortest path is 11 for cell (3, 4)
The current shortest path is 13 for cell (3, 3)
The current shortest path is 16 for cell (3, 2)
The current shortest path is 21 for cell (3, 1)
The current shortest path is 5 for cell (4, 4)
The current shortest path is 13 for cell (4, 3)
...
```

Yikes.
